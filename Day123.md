##About ES6

#Const type
- BABEL.js for ES6?
- adding const type
 - const type for object is a reference, OK to update fields but not OK to change the reference

#Template literals
- back tick instead of double quote for string?
- ${} to inlcude functions and parameters in the string literal (like BASH kind of?)
- white space and newline preserved

NOTE: Can write HTML within ES6???! Useful when using Node writing backend and want to change front end

#destructuring
- for objects and arrays
- for arrays, index is important so sometimes unused vars are given destrctured names => Solve: use , to escape
- functions take objects and destructured fields

#dot dot dot(fun! combine two things together)
- when used in function parameters, takes all the input parameters and convert it into an array
- when used in push, insert elements instead of array, can even skip push to merge arrays
- when used in objects, gonna merge to one objects with additional fields, if duplicated fields merging, the one comes after overwrites


##ES6 functional programming
#pure function
- output type depends on type of input and does not have side effects. e.g slice and splice

#array helper
- map, filter, reduce
- NOTE:in arrow function returning objects cannot use {} => syntax error, Solve: wrap with () or {} + return

#currying(React thing? don't know now but gonna know later)
- f(a,b,c) => f(a)(b)(c), change a function that takes multiple arguments to a sequence of functions that takes one parameter
- WOW Scheme-like
<pre><code>
function outer(a) {
 return function inner(b) {
 return a+b;
  }
}

//arrow function:
const res = a => b => { a + bl};
</code></pre>

##JSX
- use classname instead of class
- React virtual DOM(reconciliation) between App and real DOM, only update the element that does changes

##Promises
- Promise(resolve, reject)
- await feature(doesnt hold thread), need to use async keyword
